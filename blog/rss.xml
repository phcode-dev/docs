            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We're thrilled to share a huge update with you all today - Phoenix Code native apps are officially here! ðŸŽ‰ . Get your copy from <a href="https://phcode.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">phcode.io</a> !</p>
<p>We have been working hard over the last several months to make native apps possible. It took a lot of effort and perseverance with our limited resources to reach this far. We hope to have your support in doing more :)</p>
<p>With this update,  Phoenix Code can now run almost anywhere! Native apps are available for Windows, Mac and most Linux distributions. For Chrome-OS and other platforms, simply use the web browser version; no install needed.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="looking-back">Looking Back<a href="https://docs.phcode.dev/blog/welcome#looking-back" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Looking Back" title="Direct link to Looking Back">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>The team building Phoenix Code started its history as some of the initial team members building Brackets at Adobe from 2014. Phoenix Code took over the full time development of Brackets in 2021. We had a mammoth task to bring Brackets up to date with the latest web technologies. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/brackets/comments/tz06tn/brackets_community_announcement_phoenix_code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The result was Phoenix Code</a>- A Platform rewrite of Brackets that allowed it to run on any Web Browser. But our users were pretty clear that a desktop app was needed.</p>
<p>It was at this time that this hot new rust based tech called <a href="https://tauri.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>Tauri framework</code></a> came into the picture and we finally had the missing piece to build a truly modern and light-weight desktop app. Fast forward to 2024 and Phoenix Code now runs <em>almost</em> anywhere(<em>almost</em> as we are one step short with touch and mobile screens).</p>
<p>Phoenix Code marks the first large-scale, truly independent release from the Brackets community. Entirely homegrown within the community, it is also the largest engineering effort put into Brackets since 2015 (including Adobe).</p>

<p>Our guiding principle is to make coding as intuitive and fun as playing a video game - for web developers, designers, and students.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the native apps now available, we're starting the next phase of our journey. Beginning this month, there will be
a new update of Phoenix Code released every month with all the features that you <a href="https://github.com/phcode-dev/phoenix/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22customer+raised%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">requested</a> and <a href="https://github.com/phcode-dev/phoenix/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Feature+Request%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more</a>.</p>
