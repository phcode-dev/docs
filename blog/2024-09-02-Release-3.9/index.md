## Update on Release Schedule

In the past, we've released Phoenix Code updates on a monthly basis. However, last month we encountered an issue with our release that led to stability problems for our users.

To address this, we've taken a step back to reevaluate our release process and make improvements to ensure greater robustness and reliability going forward.

As a result, we've decided to slow down the desktop release schedule to once every two months. This will allow us to thoroughly test each update and deliver a more stable experience.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the previous release and appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to improve the quality of Phoenix Code.

We look forward to bringing you new features and improvements in a more controlled and reliable manner.
