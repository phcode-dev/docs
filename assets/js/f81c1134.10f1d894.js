Brackets was one such story. Born at Adobe,\\nit wasn\u2019t just a code editor; it was a vision to bridge the gap between designers and developers on\\nhow we build for the web. But when its creators moved on, the future of Brackets seemed uncertain.\\n\\nYet, Brackets lived on. Too many people loved it, relied on it, and believed in its potential. From that\\npassion, Phoenix Code was born\u2014not as a replacement, but as a continuation of everything Brackets stood for.\\nJoin us as we trace this journey from the birth of Brackets to the rise of Phoenix Code\u2014and discover how a\\ncommunity\u2019s dedication kept the spirit of Brackets alive.\\n\\n## Brackets 1.0 - The Beginning\\nBrackets 1.0 was released 10 years ago at Adobe, on the 4th of November 2014. At the time, Atom from GitHub was\\nthe only peer editor built on the same web-based architecture as Brackets. The web was a very different place then.\\nAdobe was preparing for a post-Flash world (Read: Thoughts on Flash - an open letter by Steve Jobs, April 2010).\\nJust a month earlier, in October 2014, HTML5 had become a W3C Recommendation.\\n\\nBrackets was born as an editor built on web standards, designed for building the web\u2014a window into the future\\nfrom Adobe. Adobe was mostly right in this vision. Visual Studio Code (VSCode), built on similar web technologies,\\nhas since risen to dominate the landscape of code editors.\\n\\nBrackets was created to serve as a bridge between Designer and Developer workflows before the time of Figma and XD.\\nHowever, Adobe was primarily about design tools. As a free developer tool, Brackets was never able to find a place\\namong its design-focused peers.\\n\\n## Brackets 2.0 - The Brackets Open Source Community is Born\\n\\nIn January 2022, Adobe [transitioned the development of Brackets](https://x.com/brackets/status/1480581149604782080) to the newly formed Brackets Community.\\nVersion 2.0 focused on establishing an independent foothold to continue Brackets\' development.\\n\\nWe kick-started the Phoenix Code project as we recognized the need to address nearly three years of\\ndevelopment backlog. This laid the groundwork for the next generation of Brackets.\\n\\n## Phoenix Code - 3.0, The Next Generation of Brackets\\n\\nWith Phoenix Code, we built the foundation to run Brackets almost anywhere with a web browser. The first web\\nversion launched in June 2023, followed by desktop builds in February 2024.\\n\\nVersion 3.0 was primarily about achieving feature parity and stability with Brackets\u2014and then surpassing it.\\n\\n## Phoenix Code - 4.0, Present & Future\\n\\nWe start this year(2025) with the [release of Phoenix Code 4.0](https://docs.phcode.dev/blog/release-4.0)- as we reach feature parity with Brackets and exceeds it\\nin most cases. With this milestone, we return to the original mission of Brackets - to serve as a\\nbridge between Designer and Developer workflows for the Web. To help *people* get things done simpler and faster.\\n\\nWith immense gratitude for our users\' support, we\'re excited to begin this next chapter of Phoenix Code."},{"id":"release-3.10","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release-3.10","editUrl":"https://github.com/phcode-dev/docs/blob/main/blog/2024-11-24-Release-3.10/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-24-Release-3.10/index.md","title":"Editor Experience Release (November-2024, V-3.10) is now Live","description":"November release(3.10) of Phoenix Code is now available for download at phcode.io.","date":"2024-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"Editor Experience","permalink":"/blog/tags/editor-experience"},{"inline":true,"label":"UI Improvements","permalink":"/blog/tags/ui-improvements"},{"inline":true,"label":"Windows","permalink":"/blog/tags/windows"},{"inline":true,"label":"Linux","permalink":"/blog/tags/linux"},{"inline":true,"label":"Mac","permalink":"/blog/tags/mac"},{"inline":true,"label":"Release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"}],"readingTime":1.555,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Arun Bose","title":"Maintainer of Phoenix and Brackets code editors","url":"https://github.com/abose","imageURL":"https://github.com/abose.png","key":"arun","page":null},{"name":"Charly P Abraham","title":"Maintainer of Phoenix and Brackets code editors","url":"https://github.com/charlypa","imageURL":"https://github.com/charlypa.png","key":"charly","page":null},{"name":"Devansh Agarwal","title":"Phoenix Code Developer","url":"https://github.com/devvaannsh","imageURL":"https://github.com/devvaannsh.png","key":"devvaannsh","page":null},{"name":"Phoenix Code Bot","title":"Our little elf who keeps the whole place together","url":"https://github.com/phoenixide","imageURL":"https://github.com/phoenixide.png","key":"phoenixBot","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"release-3.10","title":"Editor Experience Release (November-2024, V-3.10) is now Live","authors":["arun","charly","devvaannsh","phoenixBot"],"tags":["Editor Experience","UI Improvements","Windows","Linux","Mac","Release"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Phoenix Code: The Legacy of Brackets - Continued","permalink":"/blog/Blog-Legacy"},"nextItem":{"title":"HTML Workflows and stability Release (September-2024, V-3.9) is now Live","permalink":"/blog/release-3.9"}},"content":"November release(3.10) of Phoenix Code is now available for download at [phcode.io](https://phcode.io).\\n\\nThis month\'s core theme is `Editor UI improvements`.

Get your copy from [phcode.io](https://phcode.io) !\\n\\nWe have been working hard over the last several months to make native apps possible. It took a lot of effort and perseverance with our limited resources to reach this far. We hope to have your support in doing more :)\\n\\nWith this update,  Phoenix Code can now run almost anywhere! Native apps are available for Windows, Mac and most Linux distributions. For Chrome-OS and other platforms, simply use the web browser version; no install needed.\\n\\n## Looking Back\\n\\nThe team building Phoenix Code started its history as some of the initial team members building Brackets at Adobe from 2014. Phoenix Code took over the full time development of Brackets in 2021. We had a mammoth task to bring Brackets up to date with the latest web technologies. [The result was Phoenix Code](https://www.reddit.com/r/brackets/comments/tz06tn/brackets_community_announcement_phoenix_code/)- A Platform rewrite of Brackets that allowed it to run on any Web Browser. But our users were pretty clear that a desktop app was needed.\\n\\n It was at this time that this hot new rust based tech called [`Tauri framework`](https://tauri.app/) came into the picture and we finally had the missing piece to build a truly modern and light-weight desktop app. Fast forward to 2024 and Phoenix Code now runs *almost* anywhere(*almost* as we are one step short with touch and mobile screens).\\n\\nPhoenix Code marks the first large-scale, truly independent release from the Brackets community. Entirely homegrown within the community, it is also the largest engineering effort put into Brackets since 2015 (including Adobe).\\n\\n## Acknowledgements\\n\\nThis release is made possible by the Phoenix Code Team- [Arun](https://github.com/abose), [Charly](https://github.com/charlypa) and [Mathew](https://github.com/mathewdennis1). Our shiny new website [phcode.io](https://phcode.io) is built by community contribution from [Kiran](https://github.com/kiranbose).\\n\\nWe would also like to thank the S-tier community support provided by the [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) development team, esp. [Fabian](https://github.com/FabianLars).\\n\\n## Looking Ahead\\n\\n> Our guiding principle is to make coding as intuitive and fun as playing a video game - for web developers, designers, and students.\\n\\nWith the native apps now available, we\'re starting the next phase of our journey. Beginning this month, there will be\\na new update of Phoenix Code released every month with all the features that you [requested](https://github.com/phcode-dev/phoenix/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22customer+raised%22) and [more](https://github.com/phcode-dev/phoenix/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Feature+Request%22).\\n\\nHowever, our ambitions come with costs, and it\'s your support that makes all the difference.\\n\\n## How You Can Support:\\n * **Share your feedback:** https://github.com/orgs/phcode-dev/discussions\\n * **Spread the word** about Phoenix to friends and colleagues.\\n * [**Consider supporting us** on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/phoenix-ide). Every contribution helps us to keep improving and expanding Phoenix Code.\\n\\nWe\'re grateful for the incredible support this community has shown us so far. Let\'s continue to make Phoenix Code even better, together.\\n\\nWith gratitude,\\n\\nThe Phoenix Team"}]}}')}}]);
