title: Measurements
---

The **Measurements** feature displays ruler lines extending from the edges of a selected element to the edges of the Live Preview document, with labels showing exact pixel positions. This helps you position elements more accurately.

<!-- TODO: add image showing measurements feature -->

> Ruler lines appear in blue for editable elements and gray for non-editable (dynamically created) elements.

## Enabling Measurements

To enable measurements, click the **mode selector dropdown** in the Live Preview toolbar and select **Show Measurements**. By default, this option is unchecked.

<!-- TODO: add image showing how to enable measurements -->

Alternatively, you can enable measurements from the **More Options** menu *(three-dots icon)* in the Tool Box. Select **Show Measurements** to toggle it on or off.

You can also change this setting by updating the `livePreviewShowMeasurements` preference in the preferences file. Set it to `true` or `false` (default). See [Editing Preferences](../editing-text#editing-preferences) to learn how to edit the preferences file.
