# Phoenix Pro for Schools & Universities (Free)

Phoenix Code provides **Phoenix Pro free of charge** to all eligible educational institutions, teachers, and students.
Schools can deploy Phoenix Pro in two ways:

1. **Email-based automatic activation** (recommended)
2. **Educational Volume License Keys** (for labs, shared devices, and student-owned devices)

This page explains how schools and universities can obtain free Phoenix Pro access and deploy it across **any devices used within the institution**.

---

## Who Is Eligible?

Phoenix Pro is free for:

* Students and teachers with **.edu** or **.ac.*** email addresses
* Institutions we already recognize and verify
* Schools requesting **Educational Volume Licenses**
* Both **commercial and non-commercial** educational use

Volume licenses may be applied to:

* School-owned lab computers
* Shared classroom devices
* **Student/teacher-owned laptops/home computers** (per administrator distribution)

---

# Option 1: Email-Based Student & Teacher Activation (Instant)

Phoenix Pro is automatically activated for users who log in with:

* A **.edu** email
* A **.ac.*** email
* Any **recognized school domain** already onboarded to Phoenix Code

### **How It Works**

1. Open Phoenix Code
2. Sign in using your school email
3. Phoenix Pro activates instantly
4. No approval or license file required

---

## Schools Without a `.edu` or `.ac.*` Domain

Some schools, especially K-12 institutions, use custom domains.
We support these too.

### To onboard your school domain:

Email **[support@core.ai](mailto:support@core.ai)** with:

* Subject:
  **`[education support] Request to onboard <School Name>`**
* School website URL
* Admin/teacher contact email

Once your domain is approved, all users with that email domain automatically receive Phoenix Pro upon login.

---

# Option 2: Educational Volume License (For Labs + Student/Tecaher Devices)

Educational Volume Licenses allow schools to activate Phoenix Pro on devices **without requiring login**.
This is suitable for:

* Classrooms & computer labs
* Devices shared across many students
* **Student/teacher-owned laptops**, when a school wants simple bulk activation
* Younger students without email accounts

### ✔ Cost

**Free** for all educational usage.

## Requesting a Volume License Key

Email **[support@core.ai](mailto:support@core.ai)** with:

* Subject:
  **`[educational license request for <School Name>]`**
* School name
* School website
* Your role/title
* Administrator email for license management

We will approve the school and assign management access to that admin account in:

🔗 [https://account.phcode.dev/](https://account.phcode.dev/)

The admin will find a new section under:

**Advanced Settings → Educational Volume License**

From there, you can obtain the license key.

---

## How Volume License Keys Work

* Each license key is **valid for 2 weeks**
* During these 2 weeks, you may activate **unlimited devices**:
  * School-owned devices
  * Lab computers
  * Shared machines
  * **Student/teacher-owned devices (allowed)**
* Once activated, a device stays Phoenix Pro **permanently**
* After the 2-week window, the key expires
* Admins can generate a **new key at any time** for new devices

This model ensures:

* Easy deployment
* No login required on each machine

---

## Activating Phoenix Pro Using a Volume License Key (Desktop App)

On any device—lab or student-owned:

1. Open **Phoenix Code Desktop**
2. Go to:
   **Help → Manage Licenses**
3. Enter the Education Volume License Key
4. Click **Activate**

- The device now has Phoenix Pro permanently
- Login is optional
- School admin may rotate keys as needed

# Limitations

### Students without school email and no school onboarding

If a student does not have a school-provided email **and the school is not onboarded**, we currently cannot issue individual student educational licenses.

### Volume licenses must be requested by authorized school representatives

Students cannot request volume licenses directly without school/teacher approval.
