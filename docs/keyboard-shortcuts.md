# Change Keyboard Shortcuts

Now you can make your own shortcuts for any menu, so you don't have to memorize a bunch of different ones for every app. It's like customizing your game controls to play your way!
This feature is accessible in two ways: via the menu items or through the Keyboard Shortcuts panel.
