## About Recent Files Dialog

![Recent Files Dialog](images/RecentFiles/recent-files.png "Recent Files Dialog Box")

The dialog displays a list of recently opened files. Files shown in gray are not part of the **working tree** and include a cross `x` icon on the left. Clicking the icon removes the file from the **Recent Files** list.

At the bottom of the dialog, the `Clear` button removes all files from the list that are not part of the working tree.

> Files in the working tree cannot be removed directly from the recent files list. To remove these files, remove them from the working tree first.

## File Path Display

The bottom-left corner of the dialog shows the path of the currently selected file. You can also view the file path by hovering over its icon.
